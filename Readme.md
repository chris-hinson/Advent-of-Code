# Advent Of Code 2021

## Goals
This was my first advent of code, so I went in with almost no expectations.  
However, I've been particularly enjoying writing in Rust as of late, so my goal for myself was to complete as many puzzles as I could using only rust and minimal external crates.

## Project Structure and running
All solutions *should* run without any external dependencies.
Solutions for each day are located in the ```/src/bin/``` directory.  ```/src/main.rs``` is a runner for these solutions.  
To run a particular day, invoke ```cargo run --bin dayX``` to invoke the runner, a simple ```cargo run ```will bring up a tui for chosing a day.
Solutions expect their input in the ```/inputs/``` directory, named ```inputXX.txt``` where XX corresponds to the day.  If this file does not exist, the solution will panic.

## Solution statuses
